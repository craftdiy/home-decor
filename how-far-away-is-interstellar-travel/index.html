Veritasium How Far Away is the Moon? (The Scale of the Universe From pinterest.com
The sheer weight of the scientific difficulties facing interstellar travel is humbling, if not existentially depressing. Interstellar travel refers to the idea of interstellar probes or crewed spacecraft moving between stars or planetary systems in a galaxy. Travel to the stars requires a revolution in energy production that could be centuries away at best. Compare this with pluto, a mere 7.5 billion kilometers away.

<p>Guesswork is the most one can do, in the absence of actual data concerning the possible psychological profiles of such travelers. The voyagers have enough electrical power and thruster fuel to keep its current suite of science instruments on until at least 2025. Itâs a promising avenue that might be achievable, depending on how the technology develops, before we. Traveling to other solar systems seem pretty easy in the movies, but in real life, it could get quite complicated.</p>

<p>The depressing answer in every study so far is that interstellar travel is centuries away. However, they are usually very far away. Two of them, the emdrive and the mach effect thruster.

<p>In other words, light from these stars, traveling at 300,000 km (186,000 mi) per second, takes four years to reach us. As of 2015, it is over 12,161,300,000 miles away from earth.

<p>We are far (far, far) from achieving technologies that could get a ship to. The depressing answer in every study so far is that interstellar travel is centuries away. Travel to the stars requires a revolution in energy production that could be centuries away at best. ;) centrifuge space craft this can be useful for space stations, and while it might be used in an interstellar ship, it's not useful to propel the ship.

<p>One always needs to take this into account when reading their answers. If you want to visit another star system in any reasonable amount of time, you need to go fast. Just about four years away if you travel at the speed of light. This is where we might find life outside or our solar system, on planet that are relatively similar to the earth.

<p>Interstellar space travel is a real pain in the neck. This kind of interstellar exploration is the ultimate goal of the voyager interstellar mission. At the time, it was at a distance of about 122 au, or about 11 billion miles (18 billion kilometers) from the sun. But at slower speeds, it's still pretty far.

<p>Interstellar travel and exploration are technically possible.in physics, anything that is forbidden completely in no way by law.but this doesnât necessarily mean that it is easy, and it certainly doesnât mean we will reach it within our lifetimes.with interstellar space travel, it causes neck problems. Just about four years away if you travel at the speed of light. For example, wikipedia lists a handful of terrestrial planets within 15 light years.
