Software project management has wider scope than software engineering process as it involves. Halstead’s metrics are included in a number of current commercial tools that count software lines of code. It is a part of project management in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored, and controlled. Unified Process Model In Software Engineering Business.</p>
