They have a sharp sense of space, distance and measurement. Essentially, they can picture concepts with their mind&#39;s eye. Visual spatial skills typically involve the use of recognizing shapes and patterns (evaluate and understand) and physically or mentally arranging those shapes and patterns into certain orders (manipulate). This means that visual learning and pictures play an important role.

<p>Vision spatial relations is the ability to perceive relationships of objects position in space. Spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space. Because the individual is processing primarily in pictures rather than words, ideas are interconnected (imagine a web). If you use the visual style, you prefer using images, pictures, colors, and maps to organize information and communicate with others.

<p>Visual spatial processing is an individual’s ability to process visual stimuli to comprehend spatial relationships between objects and to visualize different scenarios or images. This form of intelligence features as one of the 8 intelligences in howard gardner’s groundbreaking theory of multiple intelligences (1983). One approach to identifying basic components of spatial thinking is to examine what is measured by spatial ability tests.
