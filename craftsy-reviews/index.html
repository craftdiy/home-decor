Craftsy Review Ratings &amp; Customer Reviews Jun &#39;21 From bluprint.knoji.com
I got an offer to upgrade from premium to gold for $9 in my email, for a discount of $140. Justuseapp safety score for craftsy is 55.0/100. This gives you access to all of the online video classes, printable bonus materials, a weekly email newsletter with ideas and helpful tips, and access to occasional live online instructional events. The craftsy mobile app can be downloaded for free to any iphone and ipad and is reportedly increasingly easy to use.
