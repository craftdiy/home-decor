The gap between one bar and another is uniform throughout. For example, the middle point where the x and y axes meet is called the origin, and its coordinates are (0, 0). A graph ‘g’ is defined as g = (v, e) where v is a set of all vertices and e is a set of all edges in the graph. In these graphs, each vertex is connected with all the remaining vertices through exactly one edge.
